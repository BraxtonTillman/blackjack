# 🃏 Blackjack

A professional-grade Blackjack game built with modular JavaScript.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project simulates a full game of Blackjack with clean code architecture, modular design, and scalable structure. It is currently in MVP stage with plans to evolve into a secure, legal, and user-friendly online betting platform.

## 💻 Features

- Full Blackjack gameplay (hit, stand, bust, dealer logic)
- Ace handling and soft 17 rules
- Blackjack detection
- Modular file structure (Game logic, UI, State management, Event handling)
- Clean, commented, and scalable code
- Responsive UI-ready

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/braxtontillman/blackjack.git
cd blackjack
```

### 2. Open `index.html`

Open the file in a browser with a live server or via a local server (recommended).

> 💡 Note: Opening directly via `file://` may result in CORS issues. Use something like VSCode’s Live Server extension or a local development server:
>
> ```bash
> npx http-server
> ```
